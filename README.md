# Text Analyzer: A Simple Web-Based Character and Word Insight Tool

## Project Overview

This project is a straightforward, interactive web application designed to help users quickly analyze text input. Built entirely with fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), it provides immediate statistical insights into any given string of text. Whether you're checking character counts for social media, analyzing text composition, or simply curious about text patterns, this tool offers a quick and easy solution.

*(Make sure to replace this URL with your actual GitHub Pages link once it's deployed)*

## Features

The Text Analyzer provides the following key statistics and insights for any input text:

* **Total Characters:** Counts every single character in the text, including spaces, numbers, and special characters.
* **Total Alphabets:** Precisely counts all alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z).
* **Total Numbers:** Identifies and counts all numeric digits (0-9).
* **Total Special Characters:** Counts any character that is not an alphabet, number, or common whitespace (like spaces, tabs, newlines).
* **Repeating Characters:** Identifies characters that appear more than once in the text and lists them along with their respective frequencies. This is case-insensitive (e.g., 'A' and 'a' are treated as the same character for repetition counting).

## How to Use

Using the Text Analyzer is very simple and intuitive:

1.  **Open the Application:** Navigate to the [Live Demo Link](https://rohith-rathnamala.github.io/characters-analyzer/) (or open `index.html` locally in your browser).
2.  **Enter Your Text:** In the large text area provided, type or paste the text you wish to analyze.
3.  **Analyze:** Click the "Analyze Text" button.
4.  **View Results:** The analysis results will instantly appear below the input section, updating the various counts and the list of repeating characters.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using the core foundational technologies of the web:

* **HTML5:** Provides the semantic structure and content of the web page.
* **CSS3:** Handles all the styling, layout, and visual presentation, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Powers all the interactive logic, including text input handling, character analysis algorithms, and dynamic updating of the results in the DOM. No external libraries or frameworks were used.
